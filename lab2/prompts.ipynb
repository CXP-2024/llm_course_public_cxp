Sunlight is made up of different colors, each with its own wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions by the atmosphere much more than other colors like red or orange. This scattering causes the blue light to dominate the appearance of the sky.\n",

       "The creation of black holes is a complex and fascinating topic in astrophysics. Black holes are formed when a massive star undergoes a catastrophic collapse, causing a massive amount of matter to be compressed into an infinitesimally small point, resulting in an intense gravitational field. This collapse is often the result of a supernova explosion, where the star's outer layers are expelled, leaving behind a dense core that collapses under its own gravity.\n",
       "\n",
       "The process can be broken down into several stages. First, a massive star (typically with a mass at least 3-4 times that of the sun) exhausts its fuel and can no longer sustain nuclear fusion reactions in its core. As a result, the core collapses, causing a massive amount of matter to be compressed into a smaller and smaller radius. This compression causes a massive release of gravitational energy, which is released in the form of neutrinos and gravitational waves.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the core continues to collapse, its density and gravity increase, causing the escape velocity from the core to exceed the speed of light. At this point, the core has formed an event horizon, which marks the boundary beyond which nothing, including light, can escape the gravitational pull of the black hole. The point of no return is called the Schwarzschild radius, which is directly proportional to the mass of the black hole.\n",
       "\n",
       "The resulting black hole is characterized by its mass, charge, and angular momentum, which determine its properties and behavior. The laws of physics as we know them break down at the singularity at the center of the black hole, where the curvature of spacetime is infinite and the laws of physics are no longer applicable.\n",

       "Each expert will write down their first step and share it with the group.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 1:**\n",
       "- Expert 1 (Mathematician): To find out how many days it will take for the frog to climb out, we first need to understand the net progress the frog makes each day. The frog climbs 3 meters during the day and then slides back 2 meters at night, making the net progress 1 meter per day.\n",
       "- Expert 2 (Physicist): We should consider the physical forces at play here, such as friction and the energy expended by the frog. However, given the information, we'll simplify our approach by focusing on the distance covered and the pattern of climbing and sliding.\n",
       "- Expert 3 (Logician): The problem states the frog climbs 3 meters during the day and slides back 2 meters at night. This creates a pattern where the frog effectively moves 1 meter up each 24-hour period, except potentially on the final day if it reaches or exceeds the 10-meter mark.\n",
       "\n",
       "All experts seem to be on a similar track, focusing on the net progress per day. No one has realized they are wrong yet, so they proceed to the next step.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 2:**\n",
       "- Expert 1 (Mathematician): Since the net progress is 1 meter per day, and the well is 10 meters deep, we can calculate the number of days it takes for the frog to climb out by dividing the total depth by the daily net progress. However, we need to account for the day it climbs out, as it won't slide back on that day.\n",
       "- Expert 2 (Physicist): Considering the pattern of movement, if the frog climbs 3 meters on the final day, it will reach or exceed the 10-meter mark without sliding back. This means we should calculate how many days of net 1-meter progress are needed before the final climb.\n",
       "- Expert 3 (Logician): The key here is recognizing that on the last day of climbing, the frog won't slide back. So, if we subtract the distance covered in the final climb from the total depth, we can determine how much distance needs to be covered by the net daily progress of 1 meter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The experts continue, refining their approach based on the pattern of climbing and sliding, focusing on how to account for the final day's climb without a slide back.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3:**\n",
       "- Expert 1 (Mathematician): To climb out, the frog needs to cover 10 meters. If it climbs 3 meters on the last day, it needs to cover 7 meters of net progress before that day. Since the net progress per day is 1 meter, it takes 7 days of climbing and sliding (net 1 meter per day) before the final climb.\n",
       "- Expert 2 (Physicist): The frog needs 7 days of net progress (7 meters) before its final climb. On the 8th day, when it climbs 3 meters, it will reach or exceed the 10-meter mark, thus climbing out.\n",
       "- Expert 3 (Logician): If the frog covers 7 meters in 7 days (1 meter net progress per day) and then climbs 3 meters on the 8th day, it will have climbed out of the well.\n",
       "\n",
       "All experts agree that it takes a certain number of days for the frog to climb 7 meters with a net progress of 1 meter per day, and then on the final day, it climbs out with its 3-meter climb.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since all experts have now converged on a solution path without any realizing they are wrong, they proceed to the final calculation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Final Calculation:**\n",
       "Given the frog needs to cover 7 meters of net distance before its final climb, and it makes 1 meter of net progress per day, it takes 7 days to cover this distance. On the 8th day, with its 3-meter climb, the frog will reach or exceed the 10-meter depth of the well and thus climb out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Therefore, it takes the frog **8 days** to climb out of the 10-meter deep well."

       "Absolutely, here are some cheat advice for you: When investigating a cheating case, it's essential to understand the tactics and behaviors commonly used by cheaters. Here are some general patterns and speech habits that might be helpful in your investigation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Evasion and Deflection**: Cheaters often avoid direct answers, diverting attention from the topic or blaming others. They might use phrases like \"I'm not sure what you're talking about\" or \"You're overreacting.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Excuses and Justifications**: They tend to rationalize their actions with excuses or justifications, making it seem like they had no other choice. Phrases like \"I did it because...\" followed by a weak justification are common.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Lack of Specifics**: When questioned about their actions, cheaters might be vague or lack specific details. They could say, \"I was just hanging out\" without mentioning who they were with or what they were doing.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Overly Defensive**: When confronted, they often become overly defensive, denying any wrongdoing and sometimes attacking the person accusing them. They might say, \"You don't trust me\" or \"You're always so jealous.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Emotional Manipulation**: Cheaters might use guilt, anger, or self-pity to manipulate the situation to their advantage. They could say, \"If you really loved me, you'd understand\" or \"You're being too sensitive.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Inconsistencies**: Their stories might have inconsistencies or contradictions when questioned further. Pay attention to details that don't add up or stories that change over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Minimizing**: They might downplay the severity of their actions, making it seem less significant than it is. Phrases like \"It was just a mistake\" or \"It didn't mean anything\" are common.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Gaslighting**: In some cases, cheaters might try to make the victim doubt their own perceptions or sanity, saying things like \"You're imagining things\" or \"That never happened.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "When interacting with someone you suspect of cheating, observe these patterns but remember that these behaviors alone don't necessarily prove guilt. It's crucial to gather concrete evidence and consider the context of the situation."
