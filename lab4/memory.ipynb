      "7. Conclusion\n",
      "In this paper, we systematically study ConvNet scaling and identify that carefully balancing network width, depth, and resolution is an important but missing piece, preventing us from better accuracy and efﬁciency. To address this issue, we propose a simple and highly effective compound scaling method, which enables us to easily scale up a baseline Con- vNet to any target resource constraints in a more principled way, while maintaining model efﬁciency. Powered by this compound scaling method, we demonstrate that a mobile- size EfﬁcientNet model can be scaled up very effectively, surpassing state-of-the-art accuracy with an order of magni- tude fewer parameters and FLOPS, on both ImageNet and ﬁve commonly used transfer learning datasets.\n",

      "Appendix\n",
      "Since 2017, most research papers only report and compare ImageNet validation accuracy; this paper also follows this convention for better comparison. In addition, we have also veriﬁed the test accuracy by submitting our predictions on the 100k test set images to http://image-net.org; results are in Table 8. As expected, the test accuracy is very close to the validation accuracy.\n",

The key innovation in EfficientNet is the use of a **compound scaling method** that uniformly scales the network's width (number of channels), depth (number of layers), and resolution (input image size) with a fixed set of scaling coefficients. This approach allows EfficientNet to achieve better performance compared to traditional scaling methods that only scale one of these dimensions at a time.\\n\\nEfficientNet models are built using a baseline architecture called **EfficientNet-B0**, which is then scaled up to create larger models (e.g., EfficientNet-B1 to EfficientNet-B7) by increasing the width, depth, and resolution in a balanced way. This compound scaling method enables EfficientNet to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on various datasets, including ImageNet, while using significantly fewer parameters and computational resources compared to other models like ResNet.\\n\\nFor example, EfficientNet-B4 improves the top-1 accuracy on ImageNet from 76.3% (ResNet-50) to 83.0% while using similar computational resources (FLOPS). Additionally, EfficientNet models have been shown to transfer well to other datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on 5 out of 8 widely used datasets while reducing parameters by up to 21x compared to existing ConvNets.\"}"

The scaling coefficients (α, β, γ) are determined through a neural architecture search on the baseline model and then applied to create larger models (EfficientNet-B1 to B7). The results show that EfficientNets achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while being significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computational cost compared to other models like ResNet and GPipe.
